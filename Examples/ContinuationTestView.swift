// MARK: - What Was Fixed

/*
 THE PROBLEM:
 - The continuation in startWebSession was being resumed multiple times
 - This happened when both clipboard detection AND error handling tried to complete
 
 THE FIX:
 1. Added `hasCompleted` flag to track if continuation was already resumed
 2. Guard all completion calls with `guard !hasCompleted else { return }`
 3. Set `hasCompleted = true` before resuming continuation
 
 RESULT:
 - Continuation can only be resumed once
 - Subsequent attempts are safely ignored
 - No more "SWIFT TASK CONTINUATION MISUSE" crash
 
 The specific error you saw:
 "Invalid \"code\" in request" (HTTP 400)
 
 This means the authorization code was invalid or expired, but the crash
 was because the error tried to resume the continuation after clipboard
 detection already had.
